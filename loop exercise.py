# For Loop
# here ending is n-1
# range(start,end,step)
# agar range - min to max , ending range is n-1
# for i in range(1,11,2):
#     print(i)


# range - max to min .ending range is n+1
# for i in range(10,0,-1):
#     print(i)

# for i in reversed(range(1,11)):
#     print(i)

# control flow statements - break and continue
# break statement is used to transfer the control flow of 
# program outside the loop

# for i in range(1,10000000000000000000000000):
#     if i==10:
#         break
#     print(i)

# continue-skipping the current iteration - continue 
# statement is used to transfet the control
# flow of program to the starting of the loop

# for i in range(1,11):
#     if i%2==0:
#         continue
